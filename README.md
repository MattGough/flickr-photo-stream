## Flickr Photo Stream

This is a web app built for this [Flickr Challenge](https://github.com/holidayextras/culture/blob/master/recruitment/developer-flickr-task.md). The main task is to display a photo stream with relevant photo info from the Flickr Api.

This app is built using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), with [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) for feature testing and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) for unit testing.
